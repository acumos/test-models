# Loopback Model

This directory holds a demonstration model for Acumos.  The model is
built using Python, and its only behavior is to echo back the data
sent in.  This supports testing and deployment activities.


## Building the model

Prerequisites for building the model:

 * Python version 3.4 or later
 * Python module acumos (install via "pip install acumos")

Build the model by running the included shell script::

    create-loopback-bundle.sh

The script serializes the model to disk, then creates a bundle
suitable for onboarding to Acumos.  A sample session follows::

    $ ./create-loopback-bundle.sh
    ./create-loopback-bundle.sh: Invoking python to create the model
    Acumos version is 0.6.4
    model function says hi
    dumping model to subdir bundle-loopback
    ./create-loopback-bundle.sh: Invoking zip to create the bundle
    updating: metadata.json (deflated 47%)
    updating: model.proto (deflated 20%)
    updating: model.zip (stored 0%)
    ./create-loopback-bundle.sh: Bundle contents:
    Archive:  bundle-loopback.zip
          Length      Date    Time    Name
    ---------  ---------- -----   ----
          441  10-07-2018 07:13   metadata.json
          178  10-07-2018 07:13   model.proto
         2453  10-07-2018 07:13   model.zip
    ---------                     -------
         3072                     3 files


## On-boarding the model

On-board this model to an Acumos instance using the web-onboarding
feature, which accepts the bundle zip file created here. As part of
on-boarding the model is wrapped inside a model-runner service, which
in turn is dockerized (a docker image is created).


## Running the model

Prerequisites for running the model:

 * Docker software is running (images can be pulled and started)
 * curl command-line tool
 * protoc command-line tool, version 3.4 or later

First download the docker tar file from the Acumos site, then import
("docker load") the downloaded tar file to create an image.  A sample
session follows::

	$ docker load -i loopback_e3356398-3038-4a89-83e6-8a2139d65501_1.tar
	43efe85a991c: Loading layer [==================================================>]  82.94MB/82.94MB

	$ docker images
	REPOSITORY                                                                   TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
	nexus.acumos.org:18002/loopback_e3356398-3038-4a89-83e6-8a2139d65501   1                   e88905b2ac4e        25 hours ago        1.18GB


Next start the image as a new Docker container with an argument to
map the port where the model runner micro service listens (3330) on
the host. A sample session follows::

    docker run -p3330:3330 -d e889
    9b7e801c65284d8bb8ef1db8ff6fea256ee1a25a3161504a73c31293399f42b8


### Data for the model

This model accepts a simple string message and echoes back its input.
The protocol buffer definition is in file "loopback.proto" included here.
Two versions of a sample message are provided:

 * protoc mark-up text format, in file hello-world-msg.txt
 * binary format, in file hello-world-msg.bin

The protoc mark-up text format uses "tag: value" entries, and braces to contain nested message types.
A simple example (with no nested message) follows here::

    s: "Hello, world."

The protoc command can be used to encode text in this format to binary format that is
sent to the model, and decode a binary response back to the same text format.
These operations are performed by the included test shell script.


### Posting data to the model

Use the included shell script to send data to the model, and it will
be echoed back.  This confirms the deployment is working as expected.
A sample session follows::

	$ ./test-model.sh hello-world-msg.txt
	./test-model.sh config: host=localhost, port=3330
	./test-model.sh config: protocol buffer definition file=loopback.proto, package=simplepackage
	./test-model.sh config: input message=SimpleMessage, output message=SimpleMessage, endpoint=loopback
	./test-model.sh config: POST data URL=http://localhost:3330/loopback
	./test-model.sh input: file=hello-world-msg.txt
