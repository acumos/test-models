# This file is an example to explain how to onboard a machine learning model created in R into Acumos.
# The model created here is the famous IRIS predictive model built with Random forest algorithm.

# You need to have protobuf 3 installed on your system (version 2 will not work)
# please follow the procedure once for all 
#
# git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/google/protobuf.git protobuf
# cd protobuf
# ./autogen.sh
# ./configure --prefix=`pwd`/../`uname -m`-linux-gnu
# make
# make install

# Dependencies : feel free to comment those that are already installed in your local R environement
