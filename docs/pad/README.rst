Pipeline Application Demo (PAD)
===============================

The Pipeline Application Demo (PAD) demonstrates the linkage (and propagation) of models across instances.

The PAD was created as an interactive demonstration of model interaction with these features.

- *payload logs* for download of the binary payloads that are sent to (and received from) models as they are called
- *timing measurements* for round-trip latency (where avaialble) for a single model call and its response
- *opportunistic sample dropping* and indication of the current sample (best demonstrated in multi-sample assets, like videos) at different
  models in the pipeline.  The application will automatically drop new samples if a model is currently engaged
  in analysis.

Execution
---------

This application utilizes JSON data objects, so you'll need to access it from an HTTP or HTTPS webserver 
instead of dropping it as a file into your browser (most browsers refuse to start with this method).  For that
purpose, the simple python script `simple-cors-http-server-python3.py` has been included in the project root 
directory. 


Configuration
=============

The web applcation is configured with a JSON file.  At the time of writing, this JSON file must be 
adjacent to web application and a default example is included in `assets/config/main.json`.


Pipelines
=========

Pipelines are collections of functionalies (provided by models), often to compile a single application. 
In this application demo, a pipeline is a user-defined construct that includes references to assets
and models that are to be visually avaiable in the main PAD interface.

Models
======

Models are running instances of different `Acumos <https://www.acumos.org/>`_ created model instances. The
uniform wrapping of model input, output, and endpoint specification allows the models to be interchangably
created and used in this application.
