The application classifies domain names as legitimate or malicious. Malicious domains earn their label by engaging in malicious activity, such as botnets, phishing, and malware hosting. In order to defeat security systems, attackers use domain names that are generated by algorithms. To detect domains which may be malicious, the app builds a model based on linguistic features that distinguish regular domains from those that are algorithmically generated.
